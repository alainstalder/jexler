= jexler releases

=== 1.0.17 (2017-XX-XX)

* But if the little fox...

=== 1.0.16 (2015-05-12)

* JexlerDispatcher (new): Allows to dispatch a typical stages in a jexler's
  life cycle and during event handling to individual handler methods, like
  declare(), start(), handleCronEvent(event), stop().
* Renamed the `Jexlers` class to `JexlerContainer` and the corresponding variable
  available in jexler scripts from `jexlers` to `container`.
* The shared cron4j Scheduler for CronService and DirWatcherService is no longer
  global, but per jexler container and can alternatively be explicitly set;
  stop the shared instance with the close() method of Jexlers.

=== 1.0.15 (2015-05-10)

* Removed obsolete older workaround for GROOVY-7407 with compile retries.
* Dependence to indy version of groovy-all.

=== 1.0.14 (2015-05-05)

* CronService and DirWatcherService now internally use a shared instance
  of a cron4j Scheduler to reduce the number of threads needed per service.
  Previously, each new service created its own new Scheduler instance,
  which then created a new thread. In DirWatcherService, the setter
  setSleepTimeMs() has been superseded by a new setter setCron().
* Improved multi-threading support.

=== 1.0.13 (2015-05-03)

* Improved multi-threading support.
* Various internal code refinements after inspection.
* GUI: Javascript jexlers status update requests wait until previous call
  is done (load, abort, error or timeout).

=== 1.0.12 (2015-05-02)

* New better workaround for GROOVY-7407, see user guide.

=== 1.0.11 (2015-05-01)

* Optional partial workaround for a fundamental bug with Groovy/Grape/Ivy:
  "Compilation not thread safe if Grape / Ivy is used in Groovy scripts",
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7407, see user guide.
* A compiled jexler is now only instantiated and run if it is an
  instance of groovy.lang.Script.
* GUI fix: List of jexlers updates again when showing logs/issues.

=== 1.0.10 (2015-04-18)

* When running a jexler Groovy script, now any Throwable is caught,
  not just Exception. Consequently, issues now have a getCause() method
  that returns the causing Throwable, no longer a getException() method.
* Renamed StrongerObfuscatorTool to StringObfuscatorTool and removed
  the deprecated ObfuscatorTool.
* Updated dependency to Groovy 2.4.3.

=== 1.0.9 (2015-02-23)

* Updated dependencies to current versions (like Groovy 2.4.0).
* GUI refinements: Saving jexler preserves scroll+cursor position;
  indicators if text has changed or new jexler name has been entered.
* GUI: Jexlers are saved with unix linebreaks (LF).

=== 1.0.8 (2015-02-15)

* Only GUI changed, no release of jexler-core.
* Improved GUI: Automatic scroll bars in source and status if window too small;
  dimmed status if cannot connect to web server.

=== 1.0.7 (2014-05-14)

* StrongerObfuscatorTool: Supersedes the (now deprecated) ObfuscatorTool
  for somewhat more security, see user's guide and source code.

=== 1.0.6 (2014-05-11)

* ShellTool: Fixed a bug that could cause the run() methods to hang
  depending on output size and added a way to handle each line of
  stdout and stderr with closures (see user's guide).
* User's guide: Updated use cases.

=== 1.0.5 (2013-07-29)

* Users' guide.
* CronService: Cron string "now+stop" for a single CronEvent immediately,
  followed by a single StopEvent.
* Bugfix: Catching checked Exceptions in BasicJexler and BasicMetaInfo
  around calling Groovy scripts (because Groovy scripts may throw such
  checked Exceptions without the Java compiler being aware of the
  possibility).
* Two new context parameters in web.xml: jexler.safety.script.confirmSave 
  and jexler.safety.script.confirmDelete, see user's guide for details.

=== 1.0.4 (2013-07-23)

* ShellTool: Methods with lists and maps instead of arrays.
* CronService: Cron string "now" for a single event immediately.
* Unit test coverage of jexler-core close to 100% (except for artefacts).
* GUI: Automatically updates status of jexlers every second.

== 1.0.3 (2013-07-16)

* Separated public API from internal classes.
* Added lots of unit tests.
* Javadoc.
* Maven pom and artefacts for publishing jexler-core to the
  maven central repository.

=== 1.0.2 (2013-07-05)

* Some changes and new features.

=== 0.0.3 (early prototype, 2013-03-16)

* Just Groovy.
* Webapp only.

=== 0.0.2 (early prototype, 2013-02-24)

* Simple framework.
* Webapp that allows to start/stop jexlers, edit scripts
  (in jruby, jython or groovy), view issues and log file.
* Basic command line app that allows to start/stop jexlers.

=== 0.0.1 (early prototype, 2013-02-13)

* Basic framework, unit tests, some handlers, command line and web app.
* Please ignore - about to be refactored and simplified completely.
